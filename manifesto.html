Title: Hernan Diaz Alonso / Xefirotarch: Manifesto #19
How boring has perfection become?
Here that sensation is more like painting than engineering.
The horrific-becoming-beautiful and the beautiful-becoming-horrific (grotesque)
We are becoming monsters – a species aroused by non-perfect images coming from perfect methodologies. 
So why not be optimistic? In the end such is life, such is love…
